link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] Helm is a package and install manager that standardizes and
simplifies packaging and deployment of containerized applications with Kubernetes. Unlike Kustomize, which
uses a patching approach, Helm uses templating to enable users to tailor the deployed manifests
as required.

[#exploring_helm]
== Exploring Helm

The principles of 'Helm' are as follows:

* A package manager for Kubernetes with applications packaged as charts
* Uses templates to enable applications to be configured per installation
* Parameters for the chart are held in a `values.yaml` file and consumed by the templates

[#exploring_helm_cli]
== Exploring the Helm CLI

Similar to kustomize from the previous lab, the `helm` CLI should have been installed as part of the lab
setup. Verify that it has been installed.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
helm version --short
----

This should display the version, it should look something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{v3.9.0+3.el8+ge09b16a}
----

Helm as a package manager can be used to install a helm chart into a kubernetes cluster
and can then manage the lifecycle of the application including upgrades and uninstalling the
application. However helm can also render the chart as pure yaml without installing the
application in a cluster.

Argo CD follows a philosphy of managing manifests and as a result it interacts with Helm by
having Helm templating the chart, it does not install the chart in a Kubernetes cluster. The
lifecycle of a Helm chart in Argo CD is managed by updating version of the chart Argo CD is
using and having Argo CD render the new version of the chart.

As a result for the purpose of this workshop we will be focusing on the `helm template`
command rather than `helm install`.

[#exploring_helm_chart]
== Exploring Helm Charts

In this section we will explore the chart that we will be deploying into the cluster using GitOps,
this chart will be used to deploy the same application we did previously with kustomize. We will work
with a chart in the
`documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-helm-chart` directory within the
repository you cloned.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-helm-chart
----

Next if you run the `ls` command you should see two files, `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`, as well
as a directory called templates. Lets have a look at these in more detail.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-helm-chart/Chart.yaml[Chart.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgd-helm-chart/Chart.yaml[]
----

This file is the link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file[chart definition] which specifies name, version and other characteristics of the chart.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-helm-chart/values.yaml[values.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgd-helm-chart/values.yaml[]
----

The `values.yaml` file is the default set of values that will be used by the chart. When templating or installing the chart
you can provide your own values.yaml to override some or all of these defaults as needed for a specific use case.

Notice that since this is a yaml file parameters can be hierarchical which enables grouping related parameters together as shown
by the `image` section.
